## MOSA
This is the public repository for the code MOSA (MOlecular dynamics Simulation of Argon Atoms), which can be use to analyse the following quantities of different phase of argon(which is in the box of 108 argon particles):
- pair correlation function of system
- pressure of system 
- energy plot of system
- 2D animation of syetem
### Installation
